
1
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,840
There’s no butler to wash your hands here.

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,880
You’re the only who’s been released,
and we’re staying here.

3
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,960
-Hey.
-She’s getting cocky.

4
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,720
SUNDAY
4:40 PM

5
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,800
Who do you think you are?
Daddy isn’t here.

6
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,440
-Look at us in the eyes.
-Look at us in the eyes.

7
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,600
54 HOURS INTO THE ROBBERY

8
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,080
I’m sure that tit stuff
granted you a lot of fans.

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,480
-Eh.
-Don’t move, eh.

10
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,000
-Don’t look at me daringly.
-We’re here because of you.

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,800
Isn’t enough for you
to screw eight people?

12
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,040
-You don’t stand a chance here.
-Enjoy this.

13
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,080
-Don’t touch me!
-Relax, will you?

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,920
-Cut it out!
-Hey!

15
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,600
That’s what you learn in private schools,
all against one?

16
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,360
How brave of you, isn’t it? All of you
as a pack attacking the poor girl.

17
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,080
You are the bravest one,
aren’t you, athletic boy?

18
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,320
The one who has the biggest balls, true?

19
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,640
Let’s make sure.

20
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,240
They are like quail eggs, like quail eggs.

21
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,400
How does a quail sound?
Let’s see, how does a quail sound?

22
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,680
I don’t know much about birds.

23
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,320
Then, how does a hen sound?

24
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,160
Louder.

25
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,240
Louder.

26
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,640
Very good.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,760
Helsinki, take this brats away
and this one, first.

28
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,440
Come on, the blonde one, move along.
Come on, you too. Move.

29
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,280
Wait, wait, wait.

30
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,840
Are you okay?

31
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,360
Could you give me another one?

32
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,960
No, darling, this is not an outlet shop.

33
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,320
Take it off and start rubbing.

34
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,120
I might as well take the opportunity, too.

35
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,960
It’s been over 50 hours,
going upstairs, downstairs,

36
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,440
printing money...

37
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,160
And I’m starting to need a shower.

38
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,560
Do you know what your problem is?

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,360
Your problem is that you don’t know
how much potential you have, do you?

40
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,680
You must have done it really bad
to be the loser in your class.

41
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,760
But you can still be the ball queen.

42
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,800
It’s not that difficult,
it’s like in those American movies

43
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,400
where the loser takes off her glasses

44
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,520
and all of the sudden...
bum, she is a bombshell.

45
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,280
No, I don’t wear glasses.

46
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,120
Yes, darling,
I know you don’t wear glasses.

47
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,760
But there must be something
you can do, isn’t there?

48
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,680
Dancing.

49
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,560
Well, brilliant. And what kind of dance,
what can you dance?

50
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,120
Classical and contemporary ballet.

51
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,760
I see.

52
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,840
Something else.
Some other stuff you can do.

53
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,560
Hunting.

54
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,720
Hunting?

55
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,680
With guns?

56
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,040
Fine, wow. Gosh, and you look so innocent.

57
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,200
That’s more frightening,
because what you have to do

58
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,200
is to make those suckers
see what you are capable of.

59
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,840
Show them you’re not scared.

60
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,680
Look.

61
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,840
You have to patiently wait
for the right moment.

62
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,120
Then you pretend you have it
in your sights...

63
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,800
and do something that says:

64
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,040
"My name is Alison Parker
and I’m the fucking boss."

65
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,240
You say it, repeat it. Look at yourself
and repeat, say it, say it.

66
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,960
Say it, go ahead.

67
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,840
My name is Alison Parker
and I’m the fucking boss.

68
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,760
No, but properly, mean it.
Believe it, look into your eyes.

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,960
Look at yourself, the super female
you are. Repeat it.

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,480
My name's Alison Parker
and I’m the fucking boss.

71
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,520
Who are you?

72
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,640
-The fucking boss.
-Who are you?

73
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,600
-The fucking boss!
-Who are you?

74
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,640
-The fucking boss!
-Who are you?

75
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,680
The fucking boss!

76
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,080
Has anything been sent in?

77
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,880
Excuse, I need to make
a private phone call.

78
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,560
Can you turn down the audio?
And don’t record it, won’t you?

79
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,320
-Hello?
-Hello, Salva, it’s Raquel.

80
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,080
Hello.

81
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,920
Sorry, is...

82
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,240
Is it a weird moment?

83
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,640
No, no, absurd, in fact,
I was doing some...

84
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,400
work-out on the mobile bench.

85
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,840
-Mobile bench?
-"Well, yes, it’s"

86
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,880
a machine I use to... well, to work out.

87
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,040
Well, I’ll make it quick,
I just wanted to ask you

88
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,160
if you’ve chosen the place
where to have dinner this evening.

89
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,800
Honestly I haven’t yet. You see,

90
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,280
each time I read an online review
of a restaurant

91
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,640
I’m feeling more like meeting up
at the usual place, at the Hanoi.

92
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,320
It sounds great.

93
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,120
"And we’ll leave experiments
for some another day."

94
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,960
Say at 09:00 PM, is it okay for you?

95
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,440
Say 09:00 PM, it sound very good.

96
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,360
Good.

97
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,400
Raquel.

98
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,200
"I have some more relevant information
on Retroxil."

99
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,040
Listen up everyone,
I need you to leave the tent

100
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,400
"again, it’ll take only five minutes."

101
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,880
Don’t you think
you’re being a tiny bit paranoid?

102
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,920
Do I have to remind you
that there’s a mole?

103
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,040
It doesn’t have to be a police officer.
A lot of people come in and out of here.

104
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,520
"I don’t know, the paramedics,
the Metropolitan police...."

105
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,000
Even that friend of yours
from the café was in here.

106
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,480
Fine. What have you got?

107
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,240
As I told you, Retroxil is a medicine

108
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,760
used to treat Parkinson disease,
some experiments are being carried out

109
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,000
for some muscles dystrophies,
such as Helmers’ Myopathy.

110
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,640
It’s administered intravenously.

111
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,600
As it’s made to order,

112
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,640
they know exactly where all patients live.

113
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,360
And I guess all the pharmacies
will always place the same order

114
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,760
for the same sick people,

115
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,800
-"won’t they?
-Correct.

116
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,200
But there has been
an unusual demand in Toledo."

117
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,040
These last five months, have a look,
the distributor dispatched

118
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,800
enough medicine to treat 40 sick people.

119
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,840
And there aren’t 40 sick people in Toledo.

120
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,200
-No, there are three
in the whole of Castilla-La Mancha.

121
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,680
Where are those pharmacies?

122
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,120
All of them are in...

123
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,360
around Illescas, about 35 kilometres away.

124
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,920
"Where was the last purchase?"

125
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,080
Look, here, in Palomeque, on 18th October.

126
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,440
Just three days before
they went inside the Fábrica.

127
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,400
Yes. Ten packages of the medicine
were purchased.

128
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,440
Get and authorization from judge Andrade

129
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,240
"and go to that pharmacy, alone.

130
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,720
I want you to get hold of all the lists"

131
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,440
of purchases. And, I don’t know,
see if you can find something.

132
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,280
-Please, don’t talk to anyone about this.
-Sure, I won’t.

133
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,440
By the way, Raquel.

134
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,400
Listen.

135
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,520
I don’t you want to think that,
because of what I said to you yesterday,

136
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,280
Mari Carmen and I are not good.

137
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,280
In fact, this very same morning...
well, we made love.

138
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,400
"Yes."

139
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,600
-How wonderful, isn’t it?
-Yes, yes, yes.

140
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,400
You can all come in now.

141
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,320
Arturito, I have a nice surprise for you.

142
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,880
You see, I want you to know that I...

143
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,080
I respect any option.

144
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,640
I even have a brother who is homosexual,
he lives in Sitges and...

145
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,560
Well, he still hasn’t talked
about it openly

146
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,960
but the whole family thinks he is.

147
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,240
He does Pilates and...

148
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,800
Actually, it’s a door
I would rather not open.

149
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,120
To be honest.

150
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,200
What door you speak? Not understand.

151
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,480
This is nice surprise
I’m telling you about.

152
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,560
About door we speak another day.

153
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,560
Helsinki, leave them on their own,
they’ll need to talk.

154
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,960
I thought they had killed you.

155
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,360
I swear I knew, I would see you again.

156
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,160
And, that’s what gave me the strength

157
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,240
even at those moments
I was fighting for my life

158
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,960
you were there, you never went away.

159
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,960
I love your neck.

160
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,120
Your hair drives me crazy.

161
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,200
This has never happened to me.

162
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,560
I promise you that I’ll get you
out of here, my love.

163
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,600
They’re coming in, aren’t they?

164
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,880
Play the one of the girl.

165
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,800
"My name is Ariadna Cascales and I’m fine,

166
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,880
physically and mentally.

167
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,640
We have been treated well
by the kidnappers

168
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,280
and I have nothing to object to."

169
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,400
It’s today’s news report
next to the hostage.

170
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,520
-"A kiss for my family."
-What’s the problem then?

171
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,560
The IC people have analysed
the video recording.

172
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,640
It seems they have used
an editing programme.

173
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,840
Are you telling me
that in 40 minutes they had enough time

174
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,560
to use special effects?

175
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,120
We think they have overlaid

176
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,320
the footage of the news report
onto an old footage.

177
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,320
The quality of the recording
is not good enough

178
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,320
to accept it as a true proof of life.

179
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,160
They have lowered the quality to 240
and it’s been done on purpose.

180
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,200
It’s a bad symptom.

181
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,440
The shooting in the Fábrica
is hitting the headlines

182
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,920
from every TV news report in this country.
The press demands at least a press note.

183
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,680
And the President’s Office
wants us to go in.

184
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,400
-I need more time.
-And I need a facelift,

185
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,560
but they want us to go in now.

186
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,040
Give me a couple of hours.

187
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,000
If in two hours I haven’t obtained
those proofs of life, then we’ll go in.

188
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,040
Agreed.

189
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,920
"Manipulating those proofs
wasn’t an intelligent move.

190
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,600
I would rather say it was..."

191
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,080
-stupid.
-"Please, Inspector,"

192
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,840
we can’t minimize our relationship

193
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,560
to these blunt messages
and to insults without a...

194
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,520
'How are you, how was your day?'

195
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,280
You go straight to the point,
don’t tell me you’re like that."

196
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,400
Look here, quite frankly
I have no time for nonsense.

197
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,680
"Well, 15 seconds more,
will not change our lives.

198
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,840
Tell me."

199
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,000
Let’s say you meet someone

200
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,960
and you sleep with him,

201
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,000
"are you one of those who gets up
in the middle of the night and..."

202
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,880
leaves not even remembering his name?
Do those things fulfil you?

203
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,720
As a matter of fact I would love to do it.

204
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,800
"Yes, but I’ve been programmed to do"

205
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:18,400
other things first, such us, I don’t know,
chat, laugh, talk about my life,

206
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,600
have a coffee, go for a walk,
go to the cinema, go dancing...

207
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,480
"Without that order of things...

208
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,120
honestly, I don’t see myself
sleeping with someone."

209
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,400
-Call me old fashioned, if you want.
-"No."

210
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,440
No, no.

211
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,280
In fact I share the same priorities,
but I would add one:

212
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,720
going to a karaoke.

213
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,640
"Call me weird, but..."

214
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,000
I can’t help it, I like it, I love it.
But, I don’t want to waste your time.

215
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,440
-Tell me.
-"It’s very simple."

216
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,360
Those proofs of life are of no value,
so we have no option but to go in.

217
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,520
"And we can either do it
to watch peacefully

218
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,320
or to free those people"

219
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,680
with gas and the whole artillery.

220
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,080
"Hold on a second,
let’s see if I have fully understood."

221
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,920
-You’re asking me to let you come in.
-"You choose:"

222
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,760
either I send in the tanks

223
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,360
or you and I have a coffee

224
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,640
and you show me
that all the hostages are alive.

225
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,160
I would be delighted to invite you in.

226
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,160
I don’t know if we’ll get to the karaoke
thing, but I can’t refuse.

227
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,200
-Raquel, I won’t let you go in there.
-I give the orders here, not you.

228
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,040
-Fine.
-Ángel.

229
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,240
Excuse.

230
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,120
Right now, there’s more work
out there than in here.

231
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,240
Also, you’re the only person I can trust.

232
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,440
Well, gentlemen, ladies.

233
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,320
We’re going in.

234
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,120
Lift your arms.

235
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,720
Go ahead.

236
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,120
Your legs.

237
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,880
Where is the Professor?

238
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,000
He asked me to excuse him,
but, due to discretion reasons,

239
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,080
he can’t be present.

240
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,360
Bear in mind that his face
is not hitting the headlines,

241
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,320
as ours are.

242
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,280
She has no guns.

243
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,800
Rio, it’s your turn, do the honours.

244
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,640
You’ll excuse us, but...

245
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,600
"we have to be conscientious."

246
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,080
Raquel.

247
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,880
It’s said that the Police are not dumb,
but sometimes they look like it.

248
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,920
Did you really think

249
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,800
-you would sneak in a micro?
-And did you think that my people

250
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,440
wouldn’t make sure I was safe?

251
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,600
Tokyo, frisk the Inspector again,

252
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,720
but this time, do it with a little more
enthusiasm, as you know how.

253
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,440
You’ve left me gob smacked,
the cops using cutting-edge technology,

254
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,320
a perianal microphone.

255
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,760
Get rid of this.

256
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,960
Have you finished?

257
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,120
Come with me, if you’d be so kind.

258
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,960
"At that moment Rio freezes.

259
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,920
Thunderbolt, as his mum
used to call him as a child,

260
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,440
when he spent
the summer afternoons running.

261
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,960
She used to say he’d be
an Olympic champion,

262
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,480
but he swapped sports for video consoles

263
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,200
and plans in the open air
for risking ending up in prison."

264
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,160
Judge Andrade,

265
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,920
it’s Detective Rubio here,

266
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,160
from the robbery with hostages in
the Fábrica Nacional de Moneda y Timbre.

267
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,400
I’m calling you because we need

268
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,760
a search and seize warrant
of a pharmacy in Toledo.

269
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,560
Yes.

270
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,080
Yes, we’re following a lead
on one of the robbers.

271
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,920
Okay.

272
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,160
Okay. We have the feeling

273
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,720
that someone is passing them
information from outside

274
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,080
and I would ask you
for your absolute discretion, please.

275
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,520
Okay. Okay, alright, much appreciated.

276
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:31,960
Good bye, bye.

277
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,320
Raquel is not here.

278
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,880
No, in fact, I just came
to have something to drink.

279
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,720
"This way, the siege laid by the police

280
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,280
onto the gang of robbers who last Friday,

281
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,120
-broke into the Fábrica Nacional..."
-Excuse me,

282
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,920
how’s that matter of the hold-up going?
Because...

283
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,480
I heard that there was some shooting
and it seems that it will go on

284
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,600
for a little longer.

285
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,400
-No, no, it’s about to end.
-Ah, really?

286
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,320
-Yes.
-Then I’m glad it is,

287
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,040
I’m very happy because...

288
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,880
My goodness, I can imagine
how awful it must be

289
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,080
for those poor people,
the hostages, I mean.

290
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,920
Let alone, for you.

291
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,280
-Do you work close to here?
-Yes, just round the corner.

292
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,640
As Raquel told me you were unemployed....

293
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,600
The thing is two months ago, I lost my job
and now I’m trying to run

294
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,960
-my own business.
-I see.

295
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,200
-Well, a small business, it’s...
-An entrepreneur.

296
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,160
Yes.

297
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,440
And what kind of business?

298
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,840
Cider.

299
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,000
-No way.
-Organic cider.

300
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,600
-My mother was from Oviedo.
-Really?

301
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,120
Yes, yes, yes.

302
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,840
I make it myself
in a workshop I have over there.

303
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,600
I, instead of nursing my mother’s
breast milk, I nursed cider.

304
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,120
Yes, my grandfather
owned a field of apple trees,

305
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,080
a small field.
And, so, I started working on it.

306
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,840
-And the workshop is near here?
-Yes, very near.

307
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,600
-I would love to taste it.
-Sure, done.

308
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,040
-One day I’ll bring you a bottle.
-Thank you.

309
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,400
The Professor told me
that he has ordered a coffee.

310
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,240
It’s decaf.

311
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,280
We don’t want you lose any sleep.

312
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,600
Let’s start with the proofs of life.

313
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,120
Go ahead!

314
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,920
For appetizers, we have here Arturo Roman,

315
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,800
CEO of the Fábrica de Moneda y Timbre.

316
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,960
Is it your intention to make me see
all the hostages one by one?

317
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,800
Correct, so you don’t lose track of them.

318
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,320
Arturo...

319
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,600
This lady is Raquel Murillo,

320
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,480
the Inspector who ordered you to be shot.

321
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,040
But don’t be frightened,
she has been thoroughly frisked

322
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,440
and she’s disarmed.
Please, treat him delicately.

323
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,280
Arturo is actually a very sensitive man

324
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,160
and he’s been a little traumatized.

325
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,520
How are you, Arturo?

326
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,760
I’d seen better days.

327
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,280
I wanted to say sorry...

328
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,880
on behalf of the Police
and my own, of course.

329
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,920
It was a terrible mistake
and I hope you get better soon.

330
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,360
Right.

331
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,000
-The next one can come in.
-No, don’t be impatient, please.

332
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,880
After we’ve had the courtesy
to let you talk with all of them.

333
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,880
I’m sorry, but I can’t be here
the whole day.

334
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,600
It’s a pity, I was starting
to have get my expectations high.

335
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,440
I’ve got a pair of scissors.

336
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,640
Sorry?

337
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,760
I took them out of fear,
but having them puts me in danger.

338
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,920
What are you talking about?

339
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,600
What are you doing?
Hide them, you’ll get us in real trouble.

340
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,600
I don’t want them.

341
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,360
-I’ll drop them right here.
-Put them away.

342
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,400
-I don’t want them.
-Please.

343
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,120
-Give them to me, give them to me.
-Arturito.

344
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,520
Move along with me.

345
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,480
What were those shots?

346
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,760
Please.

347
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,640
They’ll kill us all.

348
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,720
One after the other.

349
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,400
"One after the other,
that’s how all the hostages would talk

350
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,840
to the Inspector."

351
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,120
Would you say
the way you’d been treated is good?

352
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,400
I can’t complain.

353
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,720
"The way children queue up to talk
with Santa at a shopping centre."

354
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,960
-Have you been able to sleep?
-I’ve been able to rest.

355
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,000
She reminds me of my aunt.

356
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,880
Although my aunt’s dead.

357
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,560
Did you finish your coffee?

358
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,760
This next one I quite like,
he’s extremely quiet.

359
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:25,000
Don’t you dare say anything
about the gunshot, right?

360
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,120
-Mónica?
-Yes.

361
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,480
Are you all right?

362
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,040
Well, I’m a bit dizzy.

363
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,360
Because I’m pregnant.

364
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:46,040
Sorry for asking, but was it you
who asked for an abortion pill?

365
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,080
Yes.

366
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,440
It was me, yes,
but I have changed my mind.

367
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,400
I don’t know whether I’ll get out of here.

368
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,240
If I do, I don’t know if I would be fit
to look after this baby,

369
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,760
but I’d like to continue
with the pregnancy.

370
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,600
You will.

371
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:19,480
No matter how tough things get,
children always turn out OK.

372
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,640
The problem comes
when they grow up.

373
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,600
If I know about something, Inspector,
it’s about women and children,

374
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,360
so the mum to be should not worry,
she’ll be well looked after.

375
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,200
Next one, please.

376
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,920
Mónica, are you all right?

377
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,320
Were you also taken
to talk with the Inspector?

378
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,720
-What did she say?
-If I was fine,

379
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,920
if I was getting enough rest.
And they asked me

380
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,760
-not to say anything about the wound.
-They want a proof of life.

381
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,720
-Luckily, we’re all well.
-No, not luckily, no,

382
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,080
quite the opposite,
if the proof of life failed,

383
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,280
they’ll realize
that something isn’t going well.

384
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,640
They won’t have any other choice
but to come in.

385
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,680
Listen to me, Alison.

386
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,120
Only you can get us out,
you have to disappear

387
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,880
while the proof of live is taken place.

388
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,360
-There’s a hidden safety box.
-No.

389
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,000
You only have to get into it
and lock it from inside.

390
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,600
-There’s a sequence of numbers.
-But I can’t do that.

391
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,120
You are their safe conduct, if you don’t
show up at the proof of life,

392
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,160
they’ll have no choice
but to come in for you.

393
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,520
You have to do it, it’s very easy.

394
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:59,520
-29175232, can you do it?
-29137...

395
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,040
-29175.
-2917...

396
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,760
-5.
-29175372.

397
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,120
-29175232.
-29137...

398
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,280
-29175...
-Arturo, leave her alone.

399
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,560
Leave her, can’t you see
we don’t stand a chance?

400
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,240
-I’ve been shot, you...
-Everything will be fine, take my word.

401
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,240
I’ve got hold of a pair of scissors.
Listen up.

402
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,800
If they attack you,

403
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,800
-use them to attack back.
-What are you saying?

404
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,760
-Take them with you.
-I don’t want them.

405
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,640
I’ve been told your wound opened up.

406
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,840
I tried not to limp
so they wouldn’t notice

407
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,480
and one of the stitches came out.

408
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,280
Are you okay if I have a look?

409
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,920
Okay.

410
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,840
Does she have to get undressed?

411
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,240
How do you expect him to cure me
if I don’t?

412
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,040
Can you see those doubloons there?

413
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,160
They were found
inside a Spanish sailor’s stomach.

414
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Mummified.

415
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,400
Apparently, the captain found out
that he was stealing

416
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,840
part of the cargo
they were carrying from the Indies.

417
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,000
He made him swallow all the coins
he had skimmed, one by one,

418
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,240
until he drowned.

419
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,360
Can you imagine us
applying the same punishment?

420
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,640
We would end up like a six-door
built-in wardrobe, wouldn’t we?

421
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,720
You’re very funny, Inspector.

422
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,880
I didn’t come here to tell jokes,
Fonollosa.

423
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,920
I still need to see four police officers,

424
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,640
eleven members of security
and three adolescents,

425
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,040
one of them, Alison Parker.

426
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,080
Please, you have to release the pressure,
do not be impatient.

427
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,360
Dessert is always kept for the end.

428
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,800
Right, but the dessert is taking very long

429
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,160
and I’m worried
I’ll get indigestion.

430
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,080
I want to see Parker now.

431
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,360
She’s getting ready.

432
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,480
You know what adolescents are like,
they always like to look at their best.

433
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,400
I think deep down
it’s due to that insecurity

434
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,000
that certain women have
throughout their whole lives.

435
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,040
What’s wrong with the dogs?

436
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,840
Helsinki is taking them out of their cage.

437
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,040
Stand up.

438
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:29,240
Cheer up, your boss has come to see you.
Come on, stand up.

439
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,000
"In that silence,
Inspector Murillo could hear

440
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,760
the machines working at full capacity
making banknotes

441
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,160
and she realized we had deceived her,

442
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,560
that the shooting had been a sham

443
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,880
and that going in to the museum
had only contributed

444
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,600
to give us two more hours
during which she had been off-guard.

445
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,280
And we had made 16 more million euros.

446
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:56,520
The Professor was right,
in this heist, time was precious."

447
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:00,200
In our first lesson I told you
that, somehow,

448
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,840
it won’t be stealing.

449
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,040
We won’t be stealing anything
that belongs to other people, will we?

450
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,440
Right.

451
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,000
I lied to you.

452
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,680
Because there is something
that we’ll be stealing,

453
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,080
we’ll be stealing the Police’s time.

454
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,760
We’ll put some cheese in the trap,

455
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,040
they’ll take the bait
and we’ll lead them to a dead end.

456
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,480
And they won’t be able to focus
on their main goal,

457
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,800
which is to get us all out of there.
And when we have their time

458
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,480
and their attention,

459
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,280
we only have to prolong it.

460
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,240
Stretch it, like if it was chewing-gum,

461
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,360
meanwhile the machines
are working relentlessly.

462
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,960
They’re no fools,

463
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,360
at some point they’ll realize
that all this is a game,

464
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,080
that it’s nothing but a manoeuvre
to distract their attention

465
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,040
to keep printing money.

466
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,880
Even then, they won’t be able
to do anything,

467
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,360
because it’s their duty to solve a robbery
with hostages avoiding any casualties.

468
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,480
"It looked easy.

469
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,320
Perhaps with another inspector in charge,

470
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,760
but Raquel was a woman in a men’s world,

471
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,720
a single parent in the middle of divorce,

472
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,280
a woman who had coped
with her husband’s abuse.

473
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,040
And there, in front of Berlin,
she felt comfortable,

474
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,560
like a teacher
in front of her rebellious pupils.

475
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,720
And she wasn’t going to stand idly
while he was playing her for a fool."

476
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,760
I’ve applied skin closure strips,
so you don’t need to be stitched up again.

477
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,800
Better.

478
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,480
And this, are you a surgeon now?

479
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,600
Did you at least wash your hands,
didn't you?

480
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:57,480
Of course I did, Arturito, to punch you
smelling of "Eau of fuck yourself."

481
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,720
I’m getting dizzy,
if I could go back to where I was before,

482
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,280
-to have a rest and...
-Yes.

483
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,240
Listen up, Alison, this is not negotiable.

484
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,480
I need you to do it,
I need you to do it for all of us.

485
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,840
Do you want everyone
to beat the shit out of you,

486
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,480
-your class-mates?
-What do you know?

487
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,600
What do I know?
I’ve seen how they laugh at you,

488
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,240
how they whisper behind your back,
I’ve seen them.

489
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,800
I’ve seen how they treat you,
as a fucking loser.

490
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:45,760
And you can change it all,
today, now, it’s in your hands.

491
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,080
You have the possibility
to change your fate,

492
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,560
but you have to stick to my plan, okay?

493
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,440
Can you say that you are
in generally good health, then?

494
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,280
Yes, you could say that.

495
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,880
Helsinki, please,
take him to his chambers.

496
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,960
Very well, I’ve seen all the hostages
except Alison Parker.

497
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,600
I believe it’s her turn now, isn’t it?

498
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,800
What will happen otherwise?

499
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,680
Will you handcuff us?

500
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,160
Hey, please, ladies, quiet down.

501
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,400
It’s a bit early
to take the mud and the bikinis out.

502
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:43,960
Look, since I have been in here,
I’ve only heard you say stupid things.

503
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,600
I expected something more profound
from a man who has only...

504
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,800
How much, seven months to live?

505
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,360
What is she talking about?

506
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,520
-What the fuck is going on?
-He suffers from Helmers’ Myopathy.

507
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,240
A very aggressive degenerative disease,

508
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,560
with a life expectancy of 14 to 25 months.

509
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,800
His muscles may have
already started to weaken,

510
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,640
what translates into spasms,
trembling of his hands....

511
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,960
Haven’t you noticed that it's becoming
more and more difficult to hold your gun?

512
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,040
I’ve put my foot in it.

513
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,760
I though there were no secrets
amongst you, that you were friends.

514
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,440
I want to see Alison Parker. Now.

515
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,560
Can I go to the toilet for a moment?
Please, it’s quite urgent.

516
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,200
Quickly.

517
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,720
"Condor three, any movement?

518
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,760
-Main entrance clear.
-Okay."

519
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,520
Mr Berlin.

520
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,640
Can I speak to you?

521
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,960
I wanted to tell you
that I’m feeling much better.

522
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,800
I’m less nervous and would like to go
downstairs with the other hostages.

523
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,800
Are you not well here, any complaint?

524
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,600
No, I’m well, I’m very well.

525
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,960
That’s... why that I think
I could help with some tasks

526
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,240
-you are assigning to people.
-Tell me, Ariadna,

527
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,760
-what could help with?
-Anything, whatever.

528
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,720
Cooking, breaking the ground...

529
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,040
I believe you’re building a tunnel or....

530
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,320
Can you come a bit closer?

531
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,480
Break stone with those hands
would be a crime.

532
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,680
Besides, we already have people
for that task.

533
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,440
We also have people to print,

534
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,360
to move the coils... As a matter of fact
we have people for everything.

535
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,480
Last night you took Silvia away
and we heard gunshots.

536
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,800
I can’t stand it any longer,
please, I need to get out.

537
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,760
Everyone.

538
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,160
Anguish, stress, anxiety....

539
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,800
Me, for instance,
right now, I know for sure

540
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,800
that I won’t be getting out of here alive.

541
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,720
I, at your age, also thought
I could conquer the world,

542
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,400
that I wasn’t going to look back
in my bloody life

543
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,840
and that... I’d never regret anything.

544
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,200
But one day you come

545
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,760
to a sudden stop.

546
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,360
Yes. And it’d be better
that you come to a sudden stop

547
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,000
because you have been fired from work
or that your flat has been foreclosed.

548
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,240
And not that the SWAT are shooting.

549
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:25,440
The problem is that in my case I came
to a sudden stop because of a gunshot.

550
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,360
To be more precise one I saw
with my own eyes to my boyfriend’s heart.

551
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:32,960
Go out there

552
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,800
and tell everyone

553
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,600
that I can’t feel anything.

554
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,720
And that they can come in to get me,

555
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,880
shooting.

556
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,360
"Units in alert for intervention, sir."

557
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,240
-Why the hell is she taking so long?
-"Awaiting instructions."

558
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,480
When Mussolini was being defeated
in World War II

559
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,680
and a huge black cloud
stopped him from being able to think,

560
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:03,880
he realized that the only thing
that could boost his stamina was sex.

561
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,520
He had a prostitute living
in a room next to his office.

562
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,080
He would pop in from time to time

563
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,480
so she would make him feel happy again.

564
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,840
I can help you solve your problems.

565
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,920
Do you think I could be
with a woman who would come to me

566
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,400
against her own will,

567
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,160
if I could feel her disdain, is that it?

568
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,560
I truly want.

569
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,000
Try me out.

570
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,440
Try me out, Mr Berlin.

571
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,840
I don’t even know
if I wish to be with you.

572
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,080
Why should I take a liking to you?

573
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,920
Why don’t you dance a little
so I can see you?

574
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,560
Dance.

575
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,480
"For Ariadna, to have sex
with the leading kidnapper

576
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,640
was the most certain way to save her life.

577
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,960
But what she didn’t know is
that she wasn’t in danger yet.

578
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,760
That was as desperate as innocent Alison’s
attempt to escape,

579
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,800
that had the fucking nerve
to try to run away from Nairobi.

580
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,440
Perhaps that’s what desperation gives,
the nerve.

581
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,760
And an absolute determination to hold on
to life like two vicious bitches."

582
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,920
Holy shit! Alison!

583
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,640
Alison!

584
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,040
Alison!

585
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,120
-Hello, Salva. How are you doing?
-Fine.

586
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,160
You see, I was
in the neighbourhood, and...

587
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,880
Anyway, I saw you coming in
and I said: "Is it Salva?"

588
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:18,960
And yes, it’s you.

589
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,400
Do you mind if I come in?

590
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,480
-Now?
-Yes, please.

591
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,640
Sure, come in. Come in.

592
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,720
What a nice place you have here.

593
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,680
Sorry for bothering you,

594
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,760
but I’m looking forward to tasting
that cider that you promised me.

595
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,240
Of course, mate, right away.

596
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,960
Thank you. Cheers.

597
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,440
I told you I was an amateur,
not a professional...

598
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,080
No, not bad, not bad at all.
To be fair, a little bitter.

599
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,000
One thing.

600
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,520
How are things with Raquel?

601
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,480
-You’re seen each other, aren’t you?
-Well, let’s see,

602
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,920
seen each other, as such,
not really, we are...

603
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,600
I mean... We’ve talked sometimes
and now we’re going on a date,

604
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,920
-that’s true, but...
-Sure.

605
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,400
And we have some affinities,
specially on my side.

606
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,920
I regard Raquel as a woman
with a lot of charisma.

607
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,960
In fact, we hardly know each other.

608
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,600
If you’re going to give her this brew,
you’d better improve it.

609
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:41,760
If you give her three glasses of that,
she’ll have a running stomach.

610
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,080
It wouldn’t be an ideal date, would it?

611
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,600
Sure, sure.
Thank you very much for the advice.

612
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,080
It must be because you left there
the apples to dry.

613
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,040
-Really?
-Yes.

614
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,080
That spot is very damp, no?

615
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:15,680
Silene, without that microphone
they don’t know whether I’m okay or not.

616
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,720
SWAT units 2 and 3 in alert.

617
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,160
-Nine minutes.
-In position.

618
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:27,280
-Perhaps, you should have a heater?
-Well, they may rot.

619
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,680
You should find other spot.

620
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,440
Look.

621
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,760
I have to leave to avoid a massacre
with or without proofs of life,

622
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:51,800
do you understand?

623
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,040
Sit down.

624
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,920
Four minutes.

625
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,680
Am I fucking making myself clear or not?
Sit down.

626
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,400
Alison, Alison, Alison.

627
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:14,720
There are 10,000 square meters here.
Who knows where the heck she is?

628
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,000
Excuse me.

629
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,240
Hello?

630
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,960
I’m going to phone the Professor,
keep looking for her.

631
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:32,000
Is it ready? Good.
Has the judge signed it?

632
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:36,400
Okay, that’s perfect.
I’m on my way there. Thank you.

633
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,880
You’ll have to excuse me,
it’s the call of duty.

634
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,360
What a shame.

635
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,200
-Don’t you want to take a bottle with you?
-No, thanks.

636
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,200
I don’t bother with it, anyway,
who uses a land line telephone?

637
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,160
Yes.

638
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,400
Second floor, office 17,
inside the safety box.

639
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,600
-Stupid kid.
-No!

640
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,240
-Alison, are you okay?
-Yes, yes.

641
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,680
We have no time,
if there’s anything, give it to me.

642
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:38,200
Weren’t you in a hurry? Hurry up then.
Rio, with me.

643
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,600
How are you, Pilar? Did you find anything?

644
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:05,200
-Yes, there was a fingerprint.
-And?

645
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,840
And there’s no match with any fingerprint
of the police officers

646
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,080
-that drive it.
-What do you mean there’s no match?

647
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,600
-Did you run it through the database?
-Yes, I did,

648
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,440
no matches,
this fingerprint is not in any base

649
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,120
-in Spain.
-I see.

650
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,920
Do me a favour.

651
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,080
Compare it against the fingerprints
on this coffee spoon, right?

652
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,120
When you have the results, call me,
it doesn’t matter what time it is.

653
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,240
-Done.
-Thank you.

654
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:32,600
-Where does the coffee spoon come from?
-Alberto.

655
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,120
Have you obtained the kidnapper’s cutlery?

656
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,560
No, it comes from somewhere else,
a hunch to be discarded.

657
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,120
You know that we can’t analyse anything

658
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,520
that has no seal
and with no registration of the origin.

659
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,760
I ask you this as a special favour for me.

660
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,120
Damn, you keep your cards
close to your chest, Angelito.

661
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,520
We know more about the robbery
from TV than from you.

662
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,160
Don’t worry, when we have the results,

663
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,320
-we’ll phone you, right?
-Thank you.

664
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:01,720
How’s Raquel?

665
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,120
Is she moving on?

666
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,280
Yes, she’s moving on, slowly.

667
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,600
Dear colleagues, after long consideration

668
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,960
I wanted to say sorry for not...

669
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:27,880
being completely honest with you.
The Inspector was right.

670
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,520
I have a degenerative disease.

671
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,760
Quite tough.

672
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,760
And I’m living on borrowed time, but...

673
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,800
it isn’t my intention to make you feel sad

674
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,000
and let alone that you feel sorry for me.

675
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,120
After all, it’s a disease

676
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,480
that one in 100,000 people suffer.

677
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,400
And that makes me a very special person.

678
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,960
What I want is to ask
you to celebrate with me. Rio.

679
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,120
We’ll all die.

680
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,240
Cheers to that.

681
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,600
Because we’re alive.

682
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,360
And because the plan is going smoothly.

683
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,560
To life.

684
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,320
And to the plan.

685
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:16,480
"Aníbal Cortés is
the weakest link in the chain.

686
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,920
That micro wouldn’t be undetected
in any frisk.

687
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,480
That’s why I said to the Science Unit

688
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,240
to place a message inside."

689
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,720
And how do we know
the boy has seen the video?

690
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,640
"Hello, son.
We’ve hired a very good lawyer

691
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,480
and he’s got you a collaboration deal
with the authorities. This."

692
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:41,040
Aníbal Cortés turning himself in
would mean that our plan is working.

693
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,920
"We have also spoken to the police
and say that if you turn yourself in

694
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,400
and agree to collaborate
in the investigation,

695
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,600
the judge will give a reduced sentence.

696
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,120
You’ll be in prison less than a year.

697
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,680
We’re doing everything we can from here

698
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,320
so you can be well
when you get out of here,

699
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,600
because you shouldn’t be there.
Think about it, please, Thunderbolt.

700
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,680
Think it over, you can back out, darling.

701
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,720
Thunderbolt, it’s not too late."

702
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,680
-Tell me, What’s wrong?
-"Are you coming home for dinner?"

703
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,360
No, I don’t think I’ll make it for dinner,
I have something to do in a pharmacy.

704
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,280
-"I’ll wait for you, i don’t mind."
-No, darling, it's not in Madrid,

705
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,120
it’s in Toledo, in a town, in Palomeque.

706
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,360
I’ll phone you later.

707
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,280
Help, please, we have just been robbed.

708
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,840
It’s okay, I’m the police.

709
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,280
He only wanted the lists
of purchases without prescriptions,

710
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:57,840
the accounts, the inventory
and the purchases book, too.

711
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,720
"And as it happens in chess,

712
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,680
there are times that, in order to win,
you need to sacrifice one of your pieces.

713
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,280
In this case, one of the most valuable,

714
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,480
our horse of Troy.

715
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,920
The Professor had placed Ángel
in a hairy situation

716
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,400
when going to that pharmacy,

717
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,480
a situation that would
send him down to hell."

718
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:34,480
Raquel, listen up, there was a guy
that arrived at the pharmacy before me.

719
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,440
No, I don’t know
how it could have happened,

720
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,320
only you and I knew about it.

721
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,080
"And that’s how it happened.

722
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,960
With a heavy heart, when old good Angelito

723
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,800
snooped around the hangar,
the Professor decided to sacrifice him."
