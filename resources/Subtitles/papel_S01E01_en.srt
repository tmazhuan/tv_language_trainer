1
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,760
Stop or I’ll shoot!

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,720
No!

3
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,400
"My name’s Tokyo.

4
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,800
But when this story started,
that wasn’t my name.

5
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,600
This was me.

6
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,920
SUSPECT'S WHEREABOUTS UNKNOWN

7
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,520
And this, the love of my life.

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,560
ROBBER GETS SHOT DEAD

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,680
The last time I saw him
I left him in a pool of blood

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,880
with his eyes open.

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,160
We did 15 clean robberies,

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,400
but mixing love and work never works.

13
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,440
So, when the security guard shot,
I had to change my job.

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,000
From robber to murderer.

15
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,520
And that’s how I started to run away.

16
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,920
Somehow, I was dead too.

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,960
Or almost dead.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,600
I had been hidden for 11 days

19
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,080
and my photo wallpapered
police stations all over Spain.

20
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,640
I’d get a 30 years’ sentence.

21
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,160
And I’m really not the type of girl
who likes getting old

22
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,400
in the cell of a prison.

23
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,360
I prefer running away.

24
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,480
Body and soul.

25
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,080
And if I can’t take my body there,

26
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,040
at least let my soul escape."

27
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,680
"I had no time left and there were
important things I had to do.

28
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,400
Just one, really."

29
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,160
Hello?

30
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,200
"Mum?"

31
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,680
Oh, my girl.

32
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,600
"How are you, sweetheart?"

33
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,640
What’s happening?

34
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,360
"Haven’t you seen the news?"

35
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,760
All those things they say about me.

36
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,200
Yes, of course I’ve seen them.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,840
You know what?

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,640
I’m thinking about going on a journey.

39
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,480
"I may join a Chinese ship.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,840
As a cook.

41
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,280
Didn’t you say
I couldn’t even make an omelette?

42
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,800
So I’ll learn. What do you think?"

43
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,000
I don’t know, sweetheart.

44
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,080
What if they only eat Chinese food?

45
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,720
What does that journey mean,

46
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,080
"that I won’t see you again?"

47
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,120
Don’t talk nonsense.

48
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,760
Of course you’ll see me.

49
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,960
"I’ll buy you a ticket
so you come to visit me."

50
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,480
Visit you where?

51
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,960
At the cemetery?

52
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,520
Are you alone?

53
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,000
"Mum, are you alone?"

54
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,400
Yes.

55
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,440
"Then go to the street,
as if you went to the market.

56
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,880
I’ll find you."

57
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,880
"And that day,
the day I was going to the slaughterhouse,

58
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,080
my guardian angel appeared.

59
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,200
But you never know for certain
what a guardian angel looks like,

60
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,600
and you’d never imagine
he’d appear in a Seat Ibiza

61
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,120
of 1992."

62
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,960
Excuse me, have you got a minute?

63
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,800
No.

64
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,240
Cooking in a Chinese ship
only has one advantage,

65
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,200
you don’t have to do the washing-up.

66
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,280
"For a moment I thought about the Chinese

67
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,720
and that I hate people who spit."

68
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,840
-Who are you, a policeman?
-Wait, wait.

69
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,760
You’re going to the slaughterhouse,
there’s a squad waiting for you

70
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,480
and they have a car since six days ago...

71
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
Why would I believe you?

72
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,520
"And that’s how I met the Professor,

73
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,200
pointing a gun to his balls."

74
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,120
May I?

75
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,920
"The good thing about relationships

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,240
is that you finally forget
how they started."

77
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,480
May I?

78
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,240
They’re already in your mother’s house.

79
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,960
That’s why I came to help you.

80
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,600
I want to propose you some business,

81
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,160
a robbery, a robbery that’s...

82
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,120
singular.

83
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,360
I’m looking for people who...

84
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,400
Well, people who don’t have much to lose.

85
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,680
What do you think about...

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,440
2,400 million euros?

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,240
"Nobody had done a job like that,

88
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,360
neither in New York,
nor in London, nor in Monte Carlo.

89
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,600
So if my picture was again in the papers,

90
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,320
at least it’d be due
to the biggest robbery ever."

91
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,040
WELCOME

92
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,080
I welcome you

93
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,080
and... I thank you
for having accepted this...

94
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,160
this job offer.

95
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,920
We’ll live here,
far from the worldly noise.

96
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,160
Five months, the five months
we’ll spend studying

97
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,840
-how to do the job.
-What do you mean, five months?

98
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,480
Are we crazy?

99
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,080
Look, people spend years studying

100
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,960
to earn a salary,
a salary which, in the best of cases,

101
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,840
is just a salary, a shitty salary.

102
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,480
What are five months?

103
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,040
I’ve been thinking about this...

104
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,480
for much longer.

105
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,240
Not to have to work ever again.

106
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,760
Neither you

107
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,080
nor your children.

108
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,840
Okay.

109
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,880
You don’t know each other yet
and I want it go on like that.

110
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,920
I don’t want any names,
or personal questions,

111
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,080
or, of course, personal relationships.

112
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,840
I want each of you to choose a name,
something simple.

113
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,720
It can be numbers, planets, cities...

114
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,440
-Like "Mister 17, miss 23."
-That’s a wrong start. I can’t

115
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,280
-remember my telephone number.
-That’s why I said that.

116
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,640
-And planets?
-I can be Mars, and he Uranus.

117
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,760
I won’t be Uranus, so forget it.

118
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,560
-What’s the matter with Uranus?
-I don’t like the rhyme.

119
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,800
-It’ll be cities. Cities.
-So cities it is.

120
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,400
Okay.

121
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,720
"That’s why I ended up being Tokyo.

122
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,040
The one looking at my arse is Mr Berlin.

123
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,480
Under arrest warrant.

124
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,000
27 robberies.

125
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,480
Jewelleries, auction houses
and security vans.

126
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,880
His biggest job,
the Champs Elysees, in Paris.

127
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,320
434 diamonds.

128
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,680
He’s like a shark in a swimming pool.

129
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,320
You can swim with him,
but you’re never calm.

130
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,280
And he was the boss
in charge of the assault."

131
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,200
"The one who coughs is Mr Moscow.

132
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,440
The first thing he dug was a mine,
in Asturias.

133
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,640
MOSCOW

134
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,800
Then he understood
that digging upwards he’d go further.

135
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,120
Six fur shops, three clock shops
and the Caja Rural in Avils.

136
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,720
He uses the thermal lance
and any industrial equipment.

137
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,960
The one sitting
behind Moscow is Denver, his son.

138
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,760
Drugs, teeth, broken ribs.

139
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,280
He’s the king of fights in discos.

140
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,760
Pure hot blood.

141
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,440
In a perfect plan, a time bomb.

142
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,440
Rio. He’s my weakness.

143
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,520
He’s like Mozart, but with computers.

144
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,520
He programmes since he was six and knows
everything about alarms and electronics.

145
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,240
For the rest of things in life
it’s as if he had been born yesterday.

146
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,960
And those are the Siamese twins,
Helsinki and Oslo.

147
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,800
Even the most sophisticated plan
needs soldiers

148
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,400
and who better than two Serbs.

149
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,560
Maybe they think,
but, frankly, we’ll never know.

150
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,000
Nairobi,

151
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,080
a hardened optimist.

152
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,800
She has forged banknotes since she was 13.

153
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,800
And now she’s our quality manager.

154
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,080
She might be crazy,
but she’s really funny."

155
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,640
Think that every day
they’ll talk about us in the news,

156
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,000
every family in the country
will be wondering

157
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,880
what we’re doing.

158
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,920
And you know what they’ll think?

159
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,600
They’ll think: "Bastards!
I wish I had come up with that idea."

160
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,840
"The Professor,
no criminal record, no register.

161
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,120
The last time he renewed his ID he was 19.

162
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,680
To all intents, a ghost,
but a very smart ghost."

163
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,520
We’re not stealing... anybody’s money,

164
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,200
because they’ll even think we’re nice.

165
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,520
And that is vital.

166
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,640
It’s vital we have the public opinion
on our side.

167
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,520
We’re going to be the fucking heroes
of all those people.

168
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,640
But very careful,
because the moment there is

169
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,040
a single drop of blood,
this is very important,

170
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,320
if there’s a single victim,

171
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,240
we’ll stop being Robin Hoods
and we’ll simply become sons of a bitch.

172
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,440
Professor.

173
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,520
Miss Tokyo.

174
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,480
What are we robbing?

175
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,000
The Fbrica Nacional de Moneda y Timbre.

176
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,920
DAY OF THE ROBBERY
FRIDAY 8:35 A.M.

177
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,040
Who chose the mask?

178
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,600
-What’s up with the mask?
-It’s not scary.

179
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,560
In bank robbery films the masks are scary.

180
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,240
They’re zombies, skeletons,
the death, I don’t know, you feel...

181
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,000
With a gun in your hand

182
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,120
I assure you a madman
is scarier than a skeleton.

183
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,360
-Stop it.
-Who was this guy with the moustache?

184
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,840
Dal, son, a Spanish painter.
He was very good.

185
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,920
-A painter.
-Yes.

186
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,720
-A painter of paintings.
-Yes.

187
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,040
Do you know what’s fucking scary?
Dolls for children.

188
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,720
They’re really scary.

189
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,680
What dolls?

190
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,880
Goofy, Pluto, Mickey Mouse, all those.

191
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,560
A mouse with ears is scarier,
that’s what you’re saying?

192
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,600
Yes, arsehole.
Do you want me to wallop you?

193
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,720
-Hey!
-I’m right. Listen to me.

194
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
If a guy at gunpoint
and wearing a Mickey Mouse mask

195
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,360
gets in a place,
the people will think he’s nuts,

196
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,360
there’s going to be a massacre.
Do you know why?

197
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,760
Because guns and children

198
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,760
are two things
you never put together, daddy.

199
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,920
-Am I right or not?
-That way it’d be more dangerous,

200
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,920
more twisted.

201
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,080
So a Jesus Christ mask
would frighten more, he’s more innocent.

202
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,800
They say "It doesn’t suit you,
it’s like Christ with two guns."

203
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,320
-"Like a saint with two guns."
-It doesn’t matter.

204
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,920
"It was obvious
there was a lack of women in the gang."

205
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,520
"A woman can spend two days
choosing shoes for a wedding,

206
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,560
but she’d never use a single minute
to choose masks for a robbery.

207
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,360
Everything we had planned was starting now

208
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,080
and during those fractions of a second
I thought about all the innocent people

209
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,520
whose lives we would stop
in their tracks."

210
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,600
E-80 LOCAL ROAD

211
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,760
"The Professor knew
there was just one way to come

212
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,960
in the Fbrica de Moneda y Timbre
with three tonnes

213
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,800
of explosive devices.
It had to be done in the lorry

214
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,720
that entered the building every week

215
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,440
with the new paper money rolls
ready to be printed.

216
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,520
And that was what we were going to do,

217
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,000
getting to the very core,
escorted by the National Police.

218
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,280
In Spain, anything guarded
by two police cars

219
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,520
is something heavily protected."

220
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,960
"But if you inhibit any possibility

221
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,440
for their communication
through the radio or telephone

222
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,400
and if you point two 26-year-old kids
with five assault rifles at their heads,

223
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,120
it doesn’t matter if they have guns,

224
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,360
and they feel just like it’d happen
to any of us."

225
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,200
I said get out of the fucking car!

226
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,600
-"They’re scared shitless."
-You’ll do as I say!

227
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,760
"Courage and heroism have a price,

228
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,800
and it’s greater
than the 1,600 euros a month

229
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,800
-a kid with a uniform gets..."
-Open the lorry, do you hear me?

230
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,160
"...or a lorry driver."

231
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,360
Come on, damn it, open!

232
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,760
"If those men had had their daughter
on the back of the lorry,

233
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,240
they’d never have opened it,
but who cares about

234
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,200
some paper money rolls with a watermark?"

235
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,640
Hurry up, hurry up!

236
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,280
Jeez, man! Come on!

237
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,360
Come on, come on!

238
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,880
Sit down. Now calm down, the three of you,
otherwise, a blow with the rifle.

239
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,480
You’ll drive with a gun in your kidneys.

240
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,080
When you get the radio call
to know if everything’s all right,

241
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,200
you’ll answer coolly,
as if everything ran smoothly.

242
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,840
Am I clear?

243
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,360
"And in the middle of that chaos with guns

244
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,280
I remembered the night before
I had been asked for my hand in marriage

245
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,800
and that I’d have preferred other plans.

246
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,680
But if you think about it,
you never find a good day for a robbery."

247
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,960
Now you know what you have to do.

248
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,160
Don’t take your eyes off the girl.

249
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,120
There can’t be any mistakes, all right?

250
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,760
She’s 17.

251
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,320
I think I can handle her.

252
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,800
Can I sit by your side?

253
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,800
Sure.

254
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,320
Hello.

255
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,840
Hello.

256
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,960
Do you want to go out with me?

257
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,480
Okay. I’m leaving.

258
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,160
No, no.

259
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,120
I don’t have to think about it.

260
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,480
I mean, yes.

261
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,080
"Okay, children, we’ve arrived.

262
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,960
Let’s go straight
to the museum’s hall, where...

263
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,040
Pedro, please, don’t behave like in class.

264
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,000
Let’s go out in an orderly way,
using both doors..."

265
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,080
And this is the façade
of the Fbrica de Moneda y Timbre.

266
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,560
The little lamb is coming in.

267
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,040
Perfect.

268
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,800
Berlin, your turn.

269
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,360
And now, be careful what you do.

270
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,200
How are you, Javi? Where’s Rafita?

271
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,840
Shift change.

272
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,560
Very well. Keep calm.

273
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,000
Okay, children, get in.

274
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,320
Slowly.

275
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,760
This is important.
As soon as we get the accreditations...

276
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,840
Keep you accreditations
hanging from your neck.

277
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,480
They must be visible
during the whole visit, okay?

278
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,400
Don’t turn around.

279
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,120
When you’re next to me,
I can’t even breathe.

280
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,000
Well, breathe,

281
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,280
because in nine months
you will really be out of breath.

282
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,360
Go ahead.

283
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,040
Well visible during the whole visit,
children.

284
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,960
The accreditation in your neck.
Lower your voice.

285
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,480
Berlin, the first camera, on your left.

286
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,000
Aren’t you going to say anything?

287
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,960
I tell you I’m pregnant,
and you just keep calm?

288
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,000
What shall I do, call my wife,
tell her to pick up the children

289
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,200
and we all go to celebrate?
For God’s sake!

290
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,680
Go on, go on. Come on.

291
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,800
ACCESS TO SECURITY SYSTEM

292
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,120
Coming in.

293
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,520
Be alert, Tokyo.

294
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,520
ACCESS TO ALARM SYSTEM

295
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,800
Great!

296
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,200
-"Alarms disengaged."
-Now.

297
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,560
Go ahead, come on.

298
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,680
It was you who said yesterday
you’re in a bad situation,

299
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,360
-you can’t stand her, you have problems.
-Problems just like any couple, Mnica,

300
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,560
like any other married couple
with three children,

301
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,080
not that I want to get divorced.

302
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,080
Mnica, I’ve had three children,
all of them with in vitro fertilisation.

303
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,240
I’ve been having sterile intercourses
with my wife for over 20 years

304
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,440
and now you tell me this.

305
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,680
You must be Shiva,
the goddess of fertility.

306
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,280
What are you insinuating?

307
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,680
I didn’t come here
looking for a pension, you know?

308
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,400
Or for a divorce,

309
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,800
and much less for a paternity test.

310
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,000
I thought you loved me.

311
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,280
And...

312
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,320
And I think it’s a nice idea.

313
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,120
Hard to make it fit in our lives, but...

314
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,840
but a wonderful idea.

315
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,320
Listen!

316
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,640
What? Do you want to know
what I’m going to do with your child?

317
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,920
-That’s what you want, right?
-Listen to me, don’t rush.

318
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,200
Don’t move!

319
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,600
Freeze.

320
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,840
Don’t move! Don’t move or I’ll kill you!

321
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,600
-What’s the matter? Do something!
-Stand up! Stand up!

322
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,960
Get out!

323
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,000
"Come on, come on!"

324
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,360
Hurry up! Don’t move!

325
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,960
Come on, come on!

326
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,360
Come on!

327
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,400
Yes, yes!

328
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,640
Fuck!

329
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,480
Come on, come on.

330
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,720
This way. Come on.

331
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,240
And this wonderful staircase,
made of marble and granite...

332
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,240
Don’t move!

333
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,240
Don’t move!

334
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,000
Don’t move! Come on!

335
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:07,920
Get back!

336
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,880
-Please, don’t!
-Professor, we have a problem.

337
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,080
I can’t see the little lamb.

338
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,840
I can’t fucking see her!

339
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,680
Miss Parker, where have you gone?

340
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,480
Wait.

341
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,720
-Please!
-Let’s go! That way!

342
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,640
Stop. Stop.

343
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,040
Okay.

344
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,240
Okay, okay.

345
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,400
I’m going too fast. I know.

346
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,280
Let’s immortalize this, right?

347
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,120
Let’s take a picture with your phone.

348
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:22,880
Wait...

349
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,040
Jesus...

350
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,560
Here? It’s a bit seedy, right?

351
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,320
It’s our first day.

352
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,120
You look so pretty.

353
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,680
I can’t find the girl.
I can’t fucking see her.

354
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,280
Open here. Open and look a bit sexy.

355
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,200
It’s your phone.
If you want, you can erase it.

356
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,400
This is for both of us, for you and me.

357
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,600
Come on, come on.

358
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,680
With this photo
you’ll be all the rage on the Internet.

359
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,600
Give me my phone! I said give it to me!

360
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,560
Give me my phone! Give it to me!

361
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,480
Give me the fucking phone!
Give me the phone!

362
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,600
Give me the phone!

363
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,160
Give me the phone!

364
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,000
First of all...

365
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,000
Good morning.

366
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,640
I’m the person who’s in charge.

367
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,520
And, first of all, I want...

368
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,920
to offer my apologies.

369
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,080
Truly, this is not the way
to end the week.

370
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,040
Phone.

371
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,800
But you’re here as hostages.

372
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,400
Phone.

373
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,680
If you obey,
I guarantee you’ll be left alive.

374
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,800
-Name.
-Alison Parker.

375
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,640
-PIN.
-2078.

376
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,800
Phone.

377
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,360
Calm down, calm down.

378
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,240
Calm down.

379
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,240
PIN.

380
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,720
Why do you need the PIN?

381
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,960
Either you tell me the fucking PIN
or I’ll blow you with my rifle butt.

382
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,960
How long are you pregnant for?

383
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,120
Eight months.

384
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,240
Eight months.

385
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,320
-PIN.
-1234.

386
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,880
You look so smart,

387
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,480
but you’ve got that shitty PIN.
What an arsehole. Your name.

388
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,720
-Arturo.
-Arturo what?

389
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,520
-Arturo Romn.
-Arturo Romn, very well. Arturito.

390
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,560
You’re our safe-conduct here,
so I’m going to protect you.

391
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,040
Hey...

392
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,240
Give me your hands. Let go.

393
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,600
Let go. Let go.

394
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,720
What’s your name?

395
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,840
Ariadna.

396
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,200
Ariadna.

397
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,560
Come with me. Come.

398
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,760
Calm down.

399
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,600
Feel my hands.

400
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,360
-Are they the hands of a monster?
-No, no.

401
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,120
Because I’m not a monster.

402
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,800
I know perfectly how you feel.

403
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,040
The dry mouth, the shortness of breath....
You have to try to calm down. Breathe in.

404
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,320
Breathe in.

405
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,760
Breathe in.

406
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,080
That’s it.
Please, breathe with me, all of you.

407
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,560
Breathe in.

408
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,120
Easy, easy.

409
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,400
Make yourself responsible
for your breathing. Breathe out.

410
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,160
Very well. Very well.

411
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,960
Miss Mnica Gaztambide, please?

412
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,360
Don’t move. Please, don’t move.

413
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,320
-Be quiet.
-I said don’t move.

414
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,360
Be quiet.

415
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,760
Miss Mnica Gaztambide,

416
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,720
would you be so kind as to step forward?

417
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,080
It’s me.

418
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,840
You’re a star, dad!

419
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,720
You’re the best!

420
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,000
You can sleep very well here, dad.

421
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,280
You can sleep grandly here.

422
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,240
Oh! Dad, dad!

423
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,560
Fucking. Here, boom!

424
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,880
Boom, boom...

425
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,840
Come on, stop fooling around
and let’s get to work. Come on, jeez.

426
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,680
This smells fucking great.

427
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,560
It smells better than roast lamb,
dad, that roast lamb.

428
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,640
-Lay down here, jeez.
-Come on, Jesus!

429
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,320
When have you had such a bed?
You didn’t have it in jail.

430
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,760
Have you seen where we are, dad?
We’re the best.

431
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,640
-We’re the best.
-Boy, don’t get this wrong.

432
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,920
We’re very small.

433
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,360
Can you do anything?

434
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,400
Have you ever had a job?

435
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,040
Have you ever left you CV anywhere?

436
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,200
Ah. Come on, jeez.

437
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,040
My CV.

438
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,240
My CV, what for?

439
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,720
To take you out of Alcal-Meco?

440
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,080
Do you think I feel proud of that?

441
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,760
12 years of my life
coming in and out of prison.

442
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,720
And you know why?

443
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,720
Why?

444
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,360
Because I’m not very smart, son.

445
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,000
And neither are you.

446
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,760
But the brains of this job
is another person.

447
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,800
And if we’re lucky
and you don’t act like an arsehole,

448
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,920
you’ll leave this place
with your life settled.

449
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,280
-I’m not acting like an arsehole.
-Come on, jeez!

450
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,080
Fill them.

451
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,920
I want you to answer the phone

452
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,840
and convince whoever it is
that we are closed

453
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,520
-due to a technical problem. Understood?
-Yes.

454
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,200
I have no choice
but to point at you with a gun.

455
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,360
-Can you feel it?
-Yes.

456
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,200
Good.

457
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,840
Now.

458
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,640
Fbrica Nacional
de Moneda y Timbre, tell me.

459
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,720
No, I’m sorry, I can’t put you
through Arturo right now.

460
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,000
The system is down.

461
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,160
No, I can’t bring him up here.

462
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,000
No, he can’t come here
to pick up the phone.

463
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,200
No, it can’t be.

464
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,800
No, because...

465
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,080
Just because,
I don’t know where he is right now,

466
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,840
I don’t know if he’s in the factory,
in the museum, in the canteen

467
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,400
or wherever he is!
And besides, that’s not my job, miss!

468
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:34,960
That was a performance worthy of an Oscar,
miss Gaztambide.

469
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,680
"20 minutes after coming in,
we started to wire

470
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,360
the analogue communication system
to talk to the Professor.

471
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,080
Without phones or radio frequency,
with nobody being able to hear us.

472
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,840
We had sealed the doors
and the alarms hadn’t set off.

473
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,160
We were like in a time limbo,
with nobody knowing

474
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,720
we had taken over
the Fbrica de Moneda y Timbre.

475
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,480
And in that sweet peace, before the storm,

476
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,520
it just seemed

477
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,200
an ordinary day."

478
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,640
You look handsome, right?

479
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,000
Who is it?

480
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,800
It’s me, let me in.

481
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,440
Rio, man. If the Professor sees us,
he’ll kill us, don’t you know?

482
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,240
I know, I know.
I have to talk to you. Sit down.

483
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,040
-What’s up?
-Sit down, jeez.

484
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,640
What’s up?

485
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,240
Tomorrow’s the robbery.

486
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,240
And we have no fucking idea
what is going to happen.

487
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,440
That’s why I want you to know
I’m serious with you

488
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,840
and I understand perfectly that, well,
that you’re not a child any more and...

489
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:42,000
and you may be looking for...
a more serious commitment.

490
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,600
That’s why I want to give you something.

491
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,360
I didn’t buy you a ring
because we’re locked up here,

492
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,200
but as soon as I go out
I’ll buy you such a big gem

493
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,080
you’ll need to carry your hand
in a fucking wheelbarrow.

494
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,560
What’s this?

495
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,680
An engagement badge?

496
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,720
Now at least you’ll know my real name.

497
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,880
Right, but we’re not allowed
to know each other’s names.

498
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,000
Well, don’t look at it.

499
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,000
But it’s yours.

500
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,320
How should I tell you this?

501
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,680
Our affair has been very well, okay?
Great.

502
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,880
We have slept together some evenings...

503
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,200
What do you mean, some?
Jeez, all of them. But four or five...

504
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,680
Sincerely, I don’t think
we’re the perfect couple.

505
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,520
-Don’t we fuck well?
-Yes, we do fuck well, wonderfully.

506
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,960
That’s a start, right?

507
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,600
But you need something more
than fucking well to be a couple, right?

508
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,160
Are you saying that because
I’m 12 years younger than you?

509
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,160
I’m going to have
300 million euros, right?

510
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,360
I’m not a child, my life is settled.

511
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,240
-Really, Rio, I wish we had...
-What do you mean with "had"?

512
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,000
There was love. There was, I was there.

513
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,000
There’s another man, right?

514
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,440
Not anymore.

515
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,280
Look, Rio,

516
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,920
when all this is over,
maybe you and I will go to Tahiti

517
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,440
and see if this works, but tomorrow
I only want to think about one thing:

518
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,960
not to get killed.

519
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,520
Rio.

520
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,680
Rio, don’t.

521
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,640
No, no.

522
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,680
You left a phone on.

523
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,920
Well, turn it off.

524
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,240
The vault is open.

525
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,760
Put on your vests and get ready to go out.

526
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,080
As soon as you’re ready,
we’ll activate the alarm.

527
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,640
Berlin, ready to open the doors.

528
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:01,720
Hostages, for your security,
all of you three steps back!

529
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,080
A little more over here. Very well.

530
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,520
Okay. Everything’s going to be all right.

531
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,240
A little closer.

532
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,040
Calm down.

533
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,880
Calm down. I can see the bags.
They’re full of money.

534
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,840
Now they’ll leave and it’ll be all right.

535
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,400
"There’s a 10-33 at the Fbrica Nacional
de Moneda y Timbre.

536
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,680
Z24 on our way.
We’ll get there in two minutes."

537
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,720
Two minutes.

538
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,480
Two minutes.

539
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,400
-Why did the alarm go off?
-I don’t know.

540
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,720
They’re just standing there,
I don’t understand.

541
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,800
-Why don’t they take the money and leave?
-I don’t know!

542
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,200
One minute, 40 seconds.

543
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,440
One minute...

544
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,120
What’s your name?

545
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,680
Arturo.

546
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,040
-Arturo, right?
-Yes. No, I haven’t seen anything!

547
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,560
I haven’t seen anything, I swear,
I haven’t seen anything!

548
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,800
-Look at me.
-I haven’t seen anything.

549
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,080
Come on, Arturo, look at me.

550
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,560
Look at me, look at me.

551
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,200
Hey, hey, come on.

552
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,680
Hey.

553
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,520
Do you like cinema?

554
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,120
Do you like it?

555
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,960
I’m... I’m a big fan.

556
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,080
Have you realised in horror films

557
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,840
there’s always someone at the beginning,
like this, a nice guy like you,

558
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:18,160
and you think: "That guy’s going to die",

559
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,360
-and then it happens?
-No...

560
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,960
He always dies.

561
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:32,440
Arturo, believe me, you’re that guy.

562
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,880
"Z24 to headquarters,
we’ll be there in 30 seconds."

563
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:38,880
30 seconds.

564
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,680
30 seconds.

565
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,840
"It’s vital that the police"

566
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,560
don’t have the faintest idea
about what we’re doing.

567
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,600
We’ll make them believe
we came in for a robbery,

568
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,400
they caught us by surprise leaving with
the money and everything was fucked up,

569
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,480
we took out the guns, shot point-blank
and we had no choice...

570
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,920
but to go back.

571
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,960
"And then, not having hurt"

572
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,160
anybody,

573
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,160
we get inside.

574
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,160
"Let them think we’re trapped like rats.

575
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,240
Let them think we’re improvising."

576
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,160
Now!

577
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,800
Tokyo! Tokyo, wait, it’s too soon!

578
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:25,960
Tokyo!

579
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,200
"Go out, throw the money,
shot at the ground and go back.

580
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,800
I’d heard that more than 30 times.

581
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,520
But what the Professor didn’t tell us

582
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,920
is that they would
also shoot point-blank."

583
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,080
Rio, Rio!

584
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,160
Holy shit, man!

585
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,440
Holy shit!

586
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,400
This couldn’t have started
fucking worse, man!

587
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,520
Fuck!

588
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,200
"Urgent support. We need urgent support.

589
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,040
In the Fbrica de Moneda y Timbre.

590
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,840
We’ve got hostile gunfire. Officer down.
I repeat, officer down."

591
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,840
"An M16 bullet is fired at 3,510 kph.

592
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,320
It flies faster than the speed of sound.

593
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,760
So if you’re shot in the heart,

594
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,880
you won’t even hear
the bullet that has killed you.

595
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,360
That’s how I knew I had fucked it all up,

596
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,600
in a millisecond

597
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,360
and the same way as usual."
